    "The COMPAS dataset is a dataset that includes criminal records and demographic information of individuals assessed by the [COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions)](https://doc.wi.gov/Pages/AboutDOC/COMPAS.aspx) risk assessment tool. The data contains information on individuals' criminal history, recidivism, and demographic attributes, which has been widely analyzed to evaluate the fairness and accuracy of risk assessments. This dataset has been utilized in studies focused on bias detection and mitigation in machine learning, especially regarding racial biases in predictive policing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Goal)** The primary goal of working with the COMPAS dataset is to evaluate and mitigate potential biases within predictive models used for assessing recidivism risk. By analyzing the dataset, the aim is to determine whether the model’s predictions are influenced by sensitive attributes like race, gender, and age, and to develop techniques to promote fairness. This includes the exploration of various bias mitigation algorithms, such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing approaches, with a particular emphasis on maintaining predictive accuracy while enhancing the equity of model outcomes.\n",
