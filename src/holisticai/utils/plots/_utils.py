    Splits the input dataset into training and testing sets based on selected features.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    X : pd.DataFrame
        The feature matrix where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.
    y : np.ndarray
        The target labels corresponding to the samples in X.
    features_to_plot : list[str]
        The list of features (column names) to select from X for plotting.
    test_size : float, optional (default=0.3)
        The proportion of the dataset to include in the test split.
    random_state : int, optional (default=42)
        Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split.

    Returns:
    -------
    X_train : np.ndarray
        Training set feature matrix (for selected features).
    X_test : np.ndarray
        Testing set feature matrix (for selected features).
    y_train : np.ndarray
        Training set target labels.
    y_test : np.ndarray
        Testing set target labels.

    -------
    KeyError
        If any of the specified `features_to_plot` are not present in `X`.
    TypeError
        If `X` is not a pandas DataFrame or `y` is not a NumPy array.

        If the size of `X` and `y` do not match.
