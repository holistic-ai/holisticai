BMBENCH
=========

The bias mitigation benchmark (BMBENCH) is a framework to simple evaluate the performance of bias mitigation algorithms. The benchmark is based on four empirical machine learning tasks: binary classification, regression, multi-class classification, and clustering. The benchmark is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend at the top of `holisticai` library.
