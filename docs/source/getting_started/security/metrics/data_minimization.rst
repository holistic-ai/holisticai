Data Minimization
=================

Data minimization is a principle aimed at limiting the amount of personal data collected and processed to what is strictly necessary for the intended purpose. This principle is crucial for maintaining privacy and reducing the risk of data breaches.

Definition and Importance
-------------------------

Data minimization involves collecting the minimal amount of data required to achieve a specific objective. This principle aligns with various privacy regulations and frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates that personal data must be:

- **Adequate**: Sufficient to properly fulfill the stated purpose.
- **Relevant**: Directly related to the purpose for which the data is collected.
- **Limited**: Only the necessary data should be collected and retained.

The goal of data minimization is to reduce the exposure of sensitive data, thereby minimizing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

Implementation Strategies
--------------------------

Several strategies can be employed to implement data minimization, including:

1. **Data Selection**: Choosing only the necessary features from the dataset that are required for the analysis or modeling task.
2. **Data Modification**: Transforming or obfuscating data to retain its utility while reducing its sensitivity.

Classes Implementing Data Minimization
--------------------------------------

The following classes demonstrate the implementation of data minimization strategies in machine learning workflows using `scikit-learn` feature selectors:

Data Selection Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**SelectorsHandler**
    - **Purpose**: Manages the selection of features based on specified criteria using `scikit-learn` selectors.
    - **Methods**:
        - **SelectPercentile**: Selects features based on a percentile of the highest scores. It uses statistical tests to determine the importance of each feature. For instance, `f_classif` can be used for classification tasks and `f_regression` for regression tasks. The top features by score are retained based on the specified percentile.
        - **VarianceThreshold**: Removes all features with variance below a certain threshold. It is a simple baseline approach that eliminates features that do not vary enough, which often do not contain useful information.
        - **SelectFromFeatureImportance**: Selects features based on their importance scores derived from a fitted model. This method relies on an attribute of the fitted model, such as `coef_` or `feature_importances_`, to determine which features to retain.

Data Modification Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**ModifierHandler**
    - **Purpose**: Applies modifications to the data to protect sensitive information while maintaining the utility of the dataset.
    - **Methods**:
        - **replace_data_with_average**: Replaces the values of less important features with their average. This method helps to reduce the sensitivity of the data while maintaining its overall structure and usefulness.
        - **replace_data_with_permutation**: Replaces the values of less important features with permuted values. This method ensures that the data retains its statistical properties while obscuring individual values to protect privacy.

The feature selection process involves filtering out the most important features and then substituting the less important features using two strategies: mean substitution and column permutation. The original model is then tested to observe changes in accuracy.

Formulations and Metrics
------------------------

When implementing data minimization, it is crucial to balance the trade-off between data utility and privacy. One effective metric to evaluate the impact of data minimization is the **Accuracy Ratio**, which compares the original model accuracy to the accuracy after data minimization.

**Accuracy Ratio Formula**:
\[ \text{Accuracy Ratio} = \frac{\text{Accuracy after Data Minimization}}{\text{Original Accuracy}} \]

This metric helps to ensure that the data minimization techniques effectively reduce the amount of sensitive information while maintaining the usefulness of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.

Discussion
----------

Data minimization is an essential principle for protecting privacy and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. By implementing effective data selection and modification strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches while maintaining the utility of their datasets.
