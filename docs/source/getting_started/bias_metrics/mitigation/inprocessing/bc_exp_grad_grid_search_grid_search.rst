Grid Search

.. note::
    **Learning tasks:** Binary classification, regression.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Grid search is a method used to select a deterministic classifier from a set of candidate classifiers obtained from the saddle point of a Lagrangian function. This method is particularly useful when the number of constraints is small, such as in demographic parity or equalized odds with a binary protected attribute. The goal is to find a classifier that balances the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Grid search involves the following steps:

1. **Candidate Classifiers**: A set of candidate classifiers is obtained from the saddle point :math:`(Q^\dagger, \lambda^\dagger)`. Since :math:`Q^\dagger` is a minimizer of :math:`L(Q, \lambda^\dagger)` and :math:`L` is linear in :math:`Q` the distribution :math:`Q^\dagger` puts non-zero mass only on classifiers that are the Q-playerâ€™s best responses to :math:`\lambda^\dagger`.
2. **Best Response Calculation**: If :math:`\lambda^\dagger` is known, one can retrieve a best response via a reduction to cost-sensitive learning.
3. **Grid Search**: When the number of constraints is small, a grid of values for :math:`\lambda` is considered. For each value, the best response is calculated, and the value with the desired tradeoff between accuracy and fairness is selected.
