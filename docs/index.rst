Our long-term goal is to offer a set of techniques to easily measure and mitigate AI risks across five  areas: Bias, Efficacy, Robustness, Privacy and Explainability. This will allow a holistic assessment of AI systems.

.. code-block::

  pip install holisticai # basic installation
  pip install holisticai[bias] # bias mitigation support
  pip install holisticai[all] # install all packages for bias and explainability
